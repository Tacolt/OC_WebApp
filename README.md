# OC_WebApp

Dev: Colt Thompson

**HOW TO: (refer to inner README for details about Node.js and ReactJS)

	Starting the server: Open Node.JS command prompt/terminal, navigate to the repo/application directory and run the following command --

	>  npm start

	Simple! Ctrl+C will stop the server as well.

**ISSUES/TODOs:
	
	*Parsing Error -- Unable to correctly parse all of the API data needed, therefore images and some names will not show.

	*Display Color Name -- Still need to hook up ImageSlider with the displayed color.

	*CSS -- The app needs some serious css still.

	*Shingle Color Gallery -- Still need to hook up to Image Slider to allow selection
